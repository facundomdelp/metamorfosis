            <p id="texto1"><strong>1</strong><br>My story started when I was a kid. I studied at a private school and at the age of 14, I had to choose between economics, humanity or exact science. What can I say? I chose wisely. At school I loved maths, physics and chemistry. So at that moment, I didn't doubt it: I wanted to be an Engineer. But, what kind of engineering? I remember well. At first, I wanted to be an informatic engineer, but not well decided, I chose Industrial engineering, because it was a wide carrer.</p>
            <p id="texto2"><strong>2</strong><br>That means, I could postpone my professional life decision. During university I loved mainly two things: How things were made and Visual Basic! I thing the second one is related to the first one, but at that days, I didn't know it.</p>
            <p id="texto3"><strong>3</strong><br>So as an insdutrial engineer student, I decided to look for a job in a factory. I started to work in an automotive glass factory. There I had the chance to visit lot of factories, and understand how things were manufactured. How things were made.</p>
            <p id="texto4"><strong>4</strong><br>Seven years and counting. This is the time I worked (and I'm working) at this glass factory. I learned a lot.<br>First of all: being a professional.<br>Second: Be an owner.<br>Third: Quality approach and troubleshooting.<br>Fourth: Team building.<br>Fifth: Working with customers<br>Sixth: Working with the labor union.<br>From the first one to the fifth one, I loved it. The last one made me think: Do I want my professional career to be limited to labor union decisions?</p>
            <p id="texto5"><strong>5</strong><br>Is there another way to create things and follow my passion?<br>During my work, I coded with VBA a lot. Nobody asked me, but I realized I could speed up lot of administrative processes. Almost nobody noticed this undercover job I made, but it was a passion to me. Even though I didn't have recognition for this, I never minded, because I liked doing it. I was almost thirty years old, I had a 40 people team, and the scene was going brighter and brighter to me. Most of my decisions were limited by the labor union. The good thing is that I leared lot of negotiations strategy, buy this is not what I wanted. My passion was with my team and with the customers. Manufacturing things. Manufacturing glass. Manufacturing code?</p>
            <p id="texto6"><strong>6</strong><br>At that days, I convinced a 35 years employee and also a friend to me, to start a professional career. He changed his life from one day to another. He choose a future and that was his self-actualization. Having things clear and learning is a nice mixture. If he can change his course, at the age of 35, why couldn't I do it. I always think of job stability. Seven years in the same place and never listen to my restlessness since now.</p>
            <p id="texto7"><strong>7</strong><br>My little brother is my guidance. He is 5 years old younger than me, and he is an excellent programmer. He start talking to me, showing things to me, so that when I said: I have to at least study how to manufacture code. How to creat webpages, applications, softwares, everything. HTML and CSS is where I needed to start. So what can I say? This story will continue.. <br>The following Lorem ipsum surely will be replaced, as soons as I continue with my new adventure..</p>
