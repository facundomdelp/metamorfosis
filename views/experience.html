                        Pilkington, the company where I started as a professional. I was studying Industrial Engineer and in that days, the only thing I wanted to do, was to work in a factory. <br><br>
                        That's the reason why I started to work as a Process Engineer trainee. Mi office was located in the middle of the factory, sourronded by productive processes. Pilkington is an automotive glass manufacturer company, all around the world. <br><br>
                        One year and a half as a trainee. I understood how "things" were manufactured. From its design up to the finished product. I learned operational excellence, 5S, looking up for improvements and measuring them with KPI's, some of them self-designed. <br><br>
                        After that, I started to work in the Quality department. This is where I currently work. As a Quality Engineer, I learned mainly two things, that nowadays are my pillars as a professional: Customer relationaship and troubleshooting. <br><br>
                        What I understood for working in Quality, is that the most important thing of the product we manufacture, is the customer experience. In Quality we have one responsability: Customer satisfaction and doing things right. <br><br>
                        From early 2021, I am in charge of the Quality department, working with a huge team: 5 engineers, 2 engineer trainees and 2 supervisors, which they have there own teams. In total, 46 people working in my team.

                        A simple job. Just for one year, but not less important. <br>
                        I was a teacher of a math workshop for 10 years old girls. Here is where I discover one of the passions I have: Teaching. <br><br>
                        The best of teaching, is that I don't need to do exclusively that in my life. We can teach everywhere. In a professional field, in a familiar field, with friends, wherever we want. <br><br>
                        The only thing we need, is someone to receive our lessons, what I have to give. <br>
                        Don't ask me to leave teaching, because I won't do it at all. I will continue teaching, even though I have nothing to give. I will always find the way for doing it. Maybe reasearching or asking to someone else, because passion for teaching borns from another passion: Learning.

                        Working in another country, and in another language.
                        Four months of work experience in the USA, where my job was to be a Lift Operator in a ski resort. <br><br>
                        Here I learned the bases: Team-building and team-working. The important thing of working together and having a purpose. Because purpose is the north in our compass. Purpose is the only thing that matters. Purpose is the only thing that will lead us to success. <br><br>
                        Morning meetings, talking about the customer experience in the mountain, understanding what the customers where expecting when they went out to ski. Vail resort had a clear purpose in that times: The experience of a lifetime. <br><br>
                        So everything we do, during our workday, had that north: Experience of a lifetime. And that experience wasn't only for the customer. It was also for us.
